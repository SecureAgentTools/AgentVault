Okay, let's draft a **Manual Collaboration Workflow (WorkflowA2A)** using your provided scripts, tailored for developing `a2agentV1` Phase 1 *without* the full ProjektFabrik automated loop, but leveraging its core ideas and scripts. This workflow emphasizes clear communication plates (templates) for each interaction type between you and me (acting as the AI developer).

**Goal:** Structure our manual interaction to maximize efficiency and minimize errors, leveraging your scripts for context preparation and file extraction.

**Core Principle:** You drive the process, execute all actions, and provide structured context/feedback to me. I generate code/tests/docs based on your inputs.

**WorkflowA2A - Manual Collaboration Steps**

**(Preparation Phase - Done Once)**

1.  **Finalize Requirements:** (We've essentially done this). Ensure the detailed Phase 1 requirements are clear and accessible (e.g., in a dedicated `REQUIREMENTS_PHASE1.md`).
2.  **Setup Project Structure:** Manually create the initial directories for the components (`a2agent_library`, `a2agent_registry`, `a2agent_cli`) and the shared `tests` directory if using a monorepo structure. Initialize Git.
3.  **Prepare Scripts:** Ensure your provided scripts (`PF_compile_project_to_text.py`, `PF_extract_and_write_files.py`) are functional and you know how to use them. `PF_compile_project_to_text.py` is key for gathering context. `PF_extract_and_write_files.py` is key for applying my output.

**(Development Cycle - Repeat for Each Logical Feature/Requirement Group)**

**Step 1: Define Work Unit (You)**

*   **Action:** Select the next logical requirement(s) or feature to implement from `REQUIREMENTS_PHASE1.md`. This might be one `REQ-` item or a small group of related items (e.g., implementing a KeyManager function and its tests).
*   **Output:** A clear statement of the immediate goal (e.g., "Implement REQ-LIB-KEY-001: Key Loading from Env Vars").

**Step 2: Gather Context (You)**

*   **Action:** Use `scripts/PF_compile_project_to_text.py` (or similar manual method) to gather the current state of **all relevant code files** for the target component(s) and any cross-component dependencies into a single text file (e.g., `temp/current_context.txt`).
*   **Action:** Extract the specific, detailed requirement text for the current Work Unit from `REQUIREMENTS_PHASE1.md`.
*   **Output:** `temp/current_context.txt` file. Text snippet of specific requirements.

**Step 3: Request Code Generation (You -> Me)**

*   **Action:** Provide me with the information using **Plate A: Code Generation Request**.
*   **Input (from You):** See Plate A details below.
*   **Output (from Me):** Code snippets formatted with `--- START/END OF FILE ---` markers, potentially including new files (`CREATE_FILE`) and modifications to existing ones.

**Step 4: Apply Generated Code (You)**

*   **Action:** Copy my *entire* response containing the code blocks. Save it to a temporary file (e.g., `temp/ai_output.txt`).
*   **Action:** Run `scripts/PF_extract_and_write_files.py temp/ai_output.txt .` (adjust project root if needed) to apply the changes to your local codebase. Review the script's output for success/errors.
*   **Output:** Modified local code files.

**Step 5: Execute & Test (You)**

*   **Action:** Run relevant checks against the modified code:
    *   Static Analysis (e.g., `ruff check .` within the component directory).
    *   Unit Tests (e.g., `pytest` within the component directory or targeting specific new test files).
    *   (Later) Integration Tests.
*   **Output:** Test results, linting errors, tracebacks, console output.

**Step 6A: Success - Review & Commit (You)**

*   **Action:** If all checks pass:
    *   Manually review the code changes (`git diff`).
    *   If satisfied, stage changes (`git add .`) and commit (`git commit -m "Implement REQ-XXX: Feature description"`).
    *   Return to Step 1 for the next Work Unit.

**Step 6B: Failure - Request Debugging/Correction (You -> Me)**

*   **Action:** If checks fail:
    *   Gather the **exact** error messages, tracebacks, and test failure summaries.
    *   Re-gather the **current code context** (including the just-applied, failing code) using `PF_compile_project_to_text.py` -> `temp/current_context.txt`.
    *   Extract the specific requirement text again.
    *   Provide this information to me using **Plate B: Debugging Request**.
*   **Input (from You):** See Plate B details below.
*   **Output (from Me):** Corrected code snippets formatted with `--- START/END OF FILE ---` markers.
*   **Action (You):** Return to Step 4 (Apply Generated Code) with the corrected code. Repeat the cycle until tests pass.

**Communication Plates (Templates for You to Provide Me)**

**Plate A: Code Generation Request**

```text
**ACTION_REQUESTED:** Generate Code

**WORK_UNIT_GOAL:** [Clear description of the immediate goal, e.g., "Implement REQ-LIB-KEY-001: Key Loading from Environment Variables within the KeyManager class"]

**TARGET_COMPONENT(S):** [Specify component key(s), e.g., "library"]

**RELEVANT_REQUIREMENTS:**
```markdown
[Paste the EXACT, DETAILED requirement text(s) from REQUIREMENTS_PHASE1.md relevant to this goal]
```

**CURRENT_CODE_CONTEXT:**
```text
[Paste the ENTIRE content of temp/current_context.txt generated by PF_compile_project_to_text.py]
```

**SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS (Optional):**
[Add any specific guidance, e.g., "Ensure the function handles missing environment variables gracefully by returning None for that key.", "Use httpx for the API call.", "Place the new class in src/a2agent_library/utils.py"]
```

**Plate B: Debugging Request**

```text
**ACTION_REQUESTED:** Debug Code / Fix Errors

**WORK_UNIT_GOAL:** [Same goal as the initial generation request, e.g., "Implement REQ-LIB-KEY-001: Key Loading from Environment Variables within the KeyManager class"]

**TARGET_COMPONENT(S):** [Specify component key(s), e.g., "library"]

**FAILED_STEP:** [Describe what failed, e.g., "Unit Tests", "Static Analysis", "Integration Test"]

**ERROR_OUTPUT / TEST_FAILURE_DETAILS:**
```text
[Paste the EXACT, COMPLETE error message, traceback, pytest summary, or linting output]
```

**RELEVANT_REQUIREMENTS:**
```markdown
[Paste the EXACT, DETAILED requirement text(s) again for context]
```

**CURRENT_CODE_CONTEXT (Including Failing Code):**
```text
[Paste the ENTIRE, UP-TO-DATE content of temp/current_context.txt generated AFTER applying the previous AI output that failed]
```

**SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS (Optional):**
[Add context if helpful, e.g., "The error seems to occur when the environment variable is not set.", "Focus on the logic within the `try...except` block in function X."]

**PREVIOUS_AI_OUTPUT_THAT_FAILED (Optional but helpful):**
```text
[If easily available, paste the --- START/END OF FILE --- blocks from my *previous* response that led to this error]
```
```

**Requirement Mapping Modification:**

We don't need to explicitly add a "Plate Mapping" to the requirements themselves. Instead, the workflow defines *when* to use each plate.

*   Use **Plate A** when starting a new feature/requirement implementation.
*   Use **Plate B** when tests or analysis fail after applying code generated from Plate A or a previous Plate B.

**Benefits of this Workflow:**

*   **Structure:** Provides a clear, repeatable process.
*   **Context:** Ensures I always have the full, relevant code context using your scripts.
*   **Clarity:** Plates define exactly what information I need for generation vs. debugging.
*   **Leverages Your Scripts:** Uses `PF_compile_project_to_text.py` and `PF_extract_and_write_files.py` effectively.
*   **Focus:** Keeps interactions focused on specific goals and error resolution.

**Potential Bottlenecks:**

*   **Context Window Management:** You need to manage the size of `temp/current_context.txt` and potentially reset our chat context periodically if it approaches limits, ensuring you re-provide the full context after a reset.
*   **Debugging Cycles:** Complex bugs might still require multiple Plate B iterations.
*   **Your Time:** The manual steps of gathering context, running tests, and formatting plates still require significant effort on your part.

This manual workflow offers a pragmatic way forward, leveraging the strengths of both your oversight/execution and my code generation/analysis capabilities, while using the helpful scripts from your original project structure.
