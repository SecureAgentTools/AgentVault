Ticket 1 (Billing):
Subject: Question about my recent invoice
Hi, I just received my invoice (INV-98765) and the charge seems higher than expected. Can you explain the 'Pro Add-on' fee? I thought I was on the standard plan. Thanks, Bill P. - billing_issue@example.net

Ticket 2 (Technical - Negative):
Subject: Widget Pro CONSTANTLY disconnecting!! WORST PRODUCT EVER!
My Widget Pro keeps dropping the Wi-Fi connection every 5 minutes! I've tried restarting everything like your useless website says. It makes the device unusable. I'm incredibly frustrated and considering returning it. Fix this!! My user ID is frustrated_user_xyz

--------------------------------------------------

Ticket 3 (Technical - Neutral):
Subject: Error E-404 on settings page
Hello, when I try to access the account settings page for my profile (standard_user_123), I get an E-404 error. The rest of the site seems fine. Can you check if the link is broken?

Ticket 4 (Sales/General - Positive):
Subject: Loving the Widget Pro! Question about features.
Just wanted to say the Widget Pro is fantastic! Really impressed. I was wondering if there's a way to export the analytics data via an API? Is that part of the Pro plan or an enterprise feature? Thanks! - vip_user@example.com

Ticket 8 (Billing - Urgent):
Subject: URGENT - Payment Failed Again!
My payment failed AGAIN today! I updated my card details yesterday after the first failure (KB-BILL-002 didn't help much). My account (needs_help_asap) might get suspended! Please help immediately!!! Order ref maybe 112233?

--------------------------------------------------

Ticket 9 (Feature Request):
Subject: Suggestion for Widget Standard
Hi team, I use Widget Standard (user_id_998877) and it's great, but I really wish it had a basic export function for the daily summary. Any plans to add this? Or is it only in Pro?

Ticket 10 (Mobile App):
Subject: Push notifications not working on Android
I've enabled push notifications in the app settings and my phone settings, but I'm not receiving any alerts from the [App Name] app on my Android phone. My user is tech_support_fan. Any ideas?
