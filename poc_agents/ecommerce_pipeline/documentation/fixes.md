# Ecommerce Pipeline Fixes

## Recent Issues Fixed

### 1. LangGraph Multiple Edges Issue
The graph was attempting to add multiple edges from the `start_pipeline` node without using a properly configured StateGraph with annotated edges.

#### Solution:
- Changed to a simple sequential flow to avoid the error
- Modified the graph.py file to have only one outgoing edge from each node
- Implemented a clear pipeline flow: start → user profile → product catalog → trends → aggregate → recommendations

### 2. Config Type Mismatch Issue
The nodes were expecting EcommercePipelineConfig objects but receiving dictionaries.

#### Solution:
- Modified all node functions to handle both EcommercePipelineConfig objects and dictionaries
- Added type validation and conversion in each node function
- Used Pydantic's model_validate to convert dictionaries to proper config objects
- Made sure error handling was robust for each node

## How to Apply Fixes

### Method 1: Apply Patch to Running Container
```bash
# Apply graph structure fix
.\patch_container.bat

# Apply config type handling fix
.\patch_nodes.bat

# Apply development mode fix
.\patch_dev_mode.bat
```

### Method 2: Rebuild Container
```bash
# First recreate network if needed
docker network create agentvault_network

# Rebuild and restart everything
.\restore_ecommerce.bat
```

### 3. Missing Agents / Development Mode
The pipeline expected all agent endpoints to be implemented and functional, but some agents might not be ready yet.

#### Solution:
- Added development mode support to allow testing the pipeline even when agents aren't implemented
- Created a direct path from start to aggregation node, bypassing the fetch steps
- Added dummy data generation in the aggregation step when no artifacts are found
- Added dummy recommendation generation to complete the pipeline flow
- Kept the original code paths for when real agents are available
## For Production Environment
These fixes maintain the core functionality while making the code more robust. The changes are particularly helpful for resource-constrained environments:

1. Sequential flow is more resource-efficient than parallel processing
2. Type checking and validation improves error handling
3. Clear linear process flow makes debugging and monitoring easier
4. Development mode allows testing the pipeline end-to-end even when some components aren't fully implemented
