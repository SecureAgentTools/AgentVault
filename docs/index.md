# Welcome to AgentVault

AgentVault is an open-source ecosystem designed to facilitate secure and interoperable communication between AI agents (Agent-to-Agent or A2A).

This documentation provides guides for users and developers interacting with or building upon the AgentVault components.

## Key Goals

*   **Interoperability:** Define standard protocols (A2A, MCP) for agents to communicate effectively.
*   **Security:** Provide mechanisms for secure key management and potentially leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).
*   **Discovery:** Enable users and agents to find other agents via a central registry.
*   **Developer Experience:** Offer SDKs and tools to simplify the development of A2A-compliant agents.

## Getting Started

*   **(Coming Soon)** Installation Guide
*   **(Coming Soon)** User Guide (CLI)
*   **(Coming Soon)** Developer Guides (Library, Server SDK, Registry, Testing)

*(This documentation is under active development alongside the AgentVault project.)*
