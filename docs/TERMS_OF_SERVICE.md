**Last Updated:** [April 12, 2025]

**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY.** By accessing or using the AgentVault Registry API (the "Service"), provided by the AgentVault Project Maintainers ("we", "us", "our"), you ("Developer", "you") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

**1. The Service**

The AgentVault Registry API is a service designed to facilitate the discovery of AI agents compatible with the AgentVault ecosystem. It allows registered developers to submit, manage, and publish metadata ("Agent Cards") describing their agents. The Service provides public endpoints for listing and retrieving these Agent Cards.

The Service **DOES NOT**:
*   Host or execute third-party AI agents.
*   Store, handle, or process end-user API keys (e.g., OpenAI keys) used by agents.
*   Monitor or proxy communication between users and agents.
*   Endorse, certify, or guarantee the functionality, security, or behavior of any agent listed in the registry.

**2. Developer Accounts & API Keys**

*   Access to submit or manage Agent Cards requires authentication using an API key provided by us.
*   You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your assigned API key. Do not share your key.
*   You are responsible for all activities that occur under your API key. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.
*   We reserve the right to revoke or suspend API keys if we suspect misuse or violation of these Terms.

**3. Agent Card Submissions & Content**

*   By submitting an Agent Card to the Service, you represent and warrant that:
    *   You own or have the necessary rights to the content included in the Agent Card.
    *   The information provided in the Agent Card is accurate, complete, and not misleading.
    *   The Agent Card content and the agent it describes comply with the [AgentVault Registry Policy](REGISTRY_POLICY.md) and all applicable laws and regulations.
    *   The Agent Card content does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other rights of any third party.
*   You grant the AgentVault Project Maintainers a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, display, reproduce, and distribute the submitted Agent Card metadata solely for the purpose of operating and promoting the AgentVault Registry and ecosystem.
*   You are solely responsible for the agent service described in your Agent Card, including its operation, security, data handling, and compliance with its own terms and privacy policy.

**4. Prohibited Use**

You agree not to use the Service to:

*   Submit Agent Cards that violate the [AgentVault Registry Policy](REGISTRY_POLICY.md).
*   Engage in any activity that is illegal, fraudulent, or harmful.
*   Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other accounts, or related systems.
*   Disrupt, interfere with, or place an unreasonable load on the Service or its infrastructure (e.g., excessive scraping, denial-of-service attacks).
*   Misrepresent your identity or affiliation.

**5. Disclaimers**

*   THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
*   WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE.
*   **WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD-PARTY AGENTS DISCOVERED THROUGH THE SERVICE.** YOUR INTERACTION WITH ANY AGENT LISTED IN THE REGISTRY IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE DO NOT VET, ENDORSE, OR GUARANTEE ANY AGENT'S PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, DATA PRACTICES, OR COMPLIANCE. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY OF ANY AGENT BEFORE INTERACTING WITH IT.

**6. Intellectual Property**

*   The AgentVault name, logos, and the Service software are the property of the AgentVault Project Maintainers or its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws.
*   You retain ownership of the content within your submitted Agent Cards, subject to the license granted in Section 3.

**7. Termination**

*   We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service (including revoking API keys and deactivating Agent Cards) at any time, with or without cause or notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful to the Service or community.
*   You may stop using the Service at any time.

**8. Limitation of Liability**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGENTVAULT PROJECT MAINTAINERS, THEIR AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (a) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (b) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY AGENTS DISCOVERED VIA THE SERVICE; OR (c) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.
